# Project-4-OOP-Game-Show-App
In this project, you'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Youâ€™ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard

Style Changes Implemented:
  - Darkened title onscreen
  - Changed font to Consolas monospaced
  - Changed wrong letter buttons from orange to red
  - Increased contrast on both win and lose screens
  - Changed live hearts to red, and lost hearts to white with a red outline

Additional Features Implemented:
  - User can choose game difficulty, and will affect available heart points
    - Easy -> 8 hearts
    - Normal -> 5 hearts
    - Hard -> 3 hearts
  - Display what the active phrase was on the game over screen
  - Show an available hint which shows which phrase group the active phrase is from
  - Easily modifiable phrases and phrase groups, through the phrasesToGuess variable in app.js
